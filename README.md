# Vehicle-Insurance-Claim-Prediction

Predicting Vehicle insurance claim amounts based on the train data set (train.csv) using 
1. Regression
         Compare evaluation metrics of different Regression models like Linear, Ridge, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors. 
2. Using classifier first to classify zero or non zero values followed by Regressor (if Classified as non zero) to predict the actual amount.
         Compare metrics of different classifiers followed by regressors in Tandem.
         
Task 1: Preprocessing the data to handle any missing values. 
Task 2: Convert categorical data to suitabe form.
Task 3: Implement the models.
